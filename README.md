# SurgiTrack 🏥

*Real-Time Surgical Status Tracking System*

## Overview

SurgiTrack is a comprehensive patient status tracking system designed to reduce anxiety for families waiting during medical procedures. Originally scoped as a simple waiting room board, our team delivered a production-ready application with full authentication, role-based access, and a responsive design.

**The Problem:** Families often spend hours in hospital waiting rooms with little to no information on their loved ones' surgical progress, leading to heightened stress and anxiety.

**Our Solution:** SurgiTrack provides a real-time status tracking system with a secure patient lookup for families, a comprehensive dashboard for staff, and instant updates displayed on public monitors in waiting rooms.
